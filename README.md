This repository is a collection of few linux scripts, I«ve put up together along the years. I’ve made them to make my Linux usage a bit more carefree: set it up once and chill.
This repo used to host just a few scripts for Ubuntu and EndeavorOS, but I’ve decided to use for **ALL** my Linux needs, distro gnostic.

The reflect my personal needs and my linux usage and also my systems. Please find bellow the list of folders with a short description.

Feel free to transform, distribute or adapt this script according to **YOUR** needs. Suggestions are very welcome.

## What's in here
**DEBIAN**
This folder contains a set of scripts specifically for [Debian](https://www.debian.org):

1. debian.sh - A post-install script. It installs stuff automagically to meet my computer needs.
2. debian_bt.sh - This script adds bluetooth support for debian (when not present), particularly on debian with [XFCE](https://xfce.org) desktop;
3. debian_iPhone.sh - A script to access and use iPhone on a Debian system;
4. debian_zoom.sh - Small script to install zoom;
5. Sources - My [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) source list for both stable and testing systems. 

**UBUNTU** 
This folder contains all of my [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) related scripts:
1. MotherFossa - this script was originally created for Ubuntu 20.04 release, and I quite enjoyed the pun between Focal Fossa and MotherF(word). This script is currently being kept up to date
2. **(deprecated)** BeverFever - script for Ubuntu 18.04
3. **(deprecated)** BuntuSources - my sources for Ubuntu: since the sources mechanism was updated on Debian and Uuntu folowed, this is no longer valid
