This repository is a collection a few of my Linux scripts. I’ve made them to make my Linux usage a bit more carefree: set it up once and chill. 
It used to host just a few scripts for Ubuntu and EndeavorOS, but I’ve decided to use for all my Linux needs.

They are also some (very) small/basic scripts to run on a freshly installed Linux system, by installing some of MY preferred software, with little to no work/human intervention.
Please find bellow the list for y folders with a short description.

Feel free to transform, distribute or adapt this script according to YOUR needs.

Suggestions are very welcome.

## What's in the zip
Some sripts to different distros. They all basically install the same sofware, but its wrintten to my spceific needs at a given time.
1. Endeavour - My [EndeavourOS](https://github.com/endeavouros-team) post-install script
2. MotherFossa - My Ubuntu 20.04 script
3. BeverFever - My Ubuntu 18.04 script

## How to use

1. [Download [zip]](https://github.com/opedromandrade/buntuscripts/archive/master.zip)
