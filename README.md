This repository is a collection a few of my Linux scripts. I’ve made them to make my Linux usage a bit more carefree: set it up once and chill. 
It used to host just a few scripts for Ubuntu and EndeavorOS, but I’ve decided to use for all my Linux needs.

They are also some (very) small/basic scripts to run on a freshly installed Linux system, by installing some of MY preferred software, with little to no work/human intervention.
Please find bellow the list for y folders with a short description.

Feel free to transform, distribute or adapt this script according to YOUR needs.

Suggestions are very welcome.

## What's in here
**DEBIAN**
This folder contains a set of scripts pecifically for [Debian](https://www.debian.org):

1. debian.sh - A post-install script. It installs stuff automagically to meet my computer needs.
2. debian_bt.sh - this script adds bluetooth support for debian (when not present) particularly on debian [XFCE](https://xfce.org)
3. debian_iPhone.sh - My [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) script to access iPhone.
4. debian_zoom.sh - My [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) to install zoom.
5. Sources - My [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) source list for both stable and testing systems.

**UBUNTU** 
This folder contains all of my [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) related scripts:
1. MotherFossa - this script was originally created for Ubuntu 20.04 release, and I quite enjoyed the pun between Focal Fossa and MotherF(word). This script is currently being kept up to date
2. **(deprecated)** BeverFever - script for Ubuntu 18.04
3. **(deprecated)** BuntuSources - my sources for Ubuntu: since the sources mechanism was updated on Debian and Uuntu folowed, this is no longer valid
